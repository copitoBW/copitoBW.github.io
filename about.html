            <p data-i18n="our_story_p1">
              SpeakNow Spanish Institute was born from a simple belief: learning Spanish should be engaging, practical, 
              and deeply connected to the rich Spanish-speaking cultures. Founded by a team of passionate educators and 
              native speakers, we saw the need for personalized, high-quality Spanish instruction that goes beyond textbooks.
            </p>
            <p data-i18n="our_story_p2">
              What started as a small group of teachers sharing their love for the Spanish language has grown into a 
              comprehensive online institute. We've maintained our core values: authentic cultural immersion, 
              personalized attention, and practical communication skills that you can use from day one.
            </p>
            <p data-i18n="our_story_p3">
              Today, we're proud to offer courses for all levels, from complete beginners to advanced speakers looking 
              to perfect their fluency. Our students come from many different backgrounds, united by their desire to connect with Spanish-speaking cultures around the world.
